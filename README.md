A *Task Manager* project built using *HTML* forms the structural foundation of a web-based application that allows users to organize and manage their daily tasks. Although HTML alone doesn't handle logic or interactivity, it plays a crucial role in building the user interface and laying out the essential elements of the application.

In a typical Task Manager layout, HTML is used to create input fields for task details such as title, description, due date, and priority. These inputs are usually placed within a <form> element, allowing users to submit new tasks. Each task is then displayed in a structured format using elements like <ul>, <li>, <div>, and <section>. Headers (<h1>, <h2>) and paragraphs (<p>) help organize content and improve readability.

Buttons for actions like "Add Task," "Edit," "Delete," and "Mark as Completed" are created using <button> tags. While these buttons rely on JavaScript to function, HTML is responsible for positioning and identifying them through attributes like id, class, and type.

HTML also supports accessibility and semantic structure, which are important for building user-friendly applications. For example, using <label> tags linked to input fields enhances form usability for screen readers.

Styling and interactivity are typically added later with CSS and JavaScript, but without a solid HTML structure, these features wouldnâ€™t function properly. A well-organized HTML layout ensures that the content is accessible, responsive, and ready for dynamic enhancements.

Building a Task Manager using HTML is a foundational step in front-end development. It allows beginners to practice creating structured and semantic web pages that can be expanded with styling and functionality. This project is an excellent way to understand how web content is structured and serves as a base for more interactive applications.
